# Peaks.js

## 0.20.0 (2020/04/25)

 * (#319) Added `timeLabelPrecision` option and `view.setTimeLabelPrecision()`
   method (@Dananji)

 * (#308) Added `waveformData` option, which allows Peaks.js to use pre-computed
   waveform data, instead of fetching the data from a web server or computing it
   using the Web Audio API (@is343)

 * Removed deprecated code, including:

   * `segments.ready` event (use `peaks.ready` or pass a callback to
     `Peaks.init()` instead)

   * `points.add()` no longer accepts a `timestamp` option (use `time` instead)

   * `points.add()` and `segments.add()` now only accept an object or an array
     of objects with point or segment data

   * `time.setCurrentTime()` and `time.getCurrentTime()` methods (use
     `player.seek()` and `player.getCurrentTime()` instead) (@chrisn)

 * Fixed error handling to use `Peaks.init()` callback consistently instead
   of throwing errors in some cases (@chrisn)

 * Enabled code coverage test reports (@chrisn)

 * Updated dependencies (@chrisn)

## 0.19.0 (2020/02/06)

 * (#309) Fixed rendering of non-editable segment marker handles (@chrisn)

   (@chrisn)

## 0.18.1 (2020/02/02)

 * (#306) Updated TypeScript declarations (@tscz)

 * Documented `zoomview.setStartTime()` (@chrisn)

## 0.18.0 (2020/02/02)

 * (#300) Redesigned the marker customization API. Refer to customizing.md
   for detailed documentation on how to customize the appearance of point
   and segment marker handles (@chrisn)

 * Added a `view.fitToContainer()` method that resizes the waveform and point
   and segment marker handles to fit the available space (@chrisn)

 * Added zoomview.setStartTime() method (@chrisn)

 * The `inMarkerColor` and `outMarkerColor` configuration options have been
   renamed to `segmentStartMarkerColor` and `segmentEndMarkerColor` (@chrisn)

 * (#305) Added a `zoomview.setZoom()` method that gives applications greater
   flexibility in setting the zoom level. The zoom level can be set to (a)
   a number of samples per pixel, as per the existing `peaks.zoom.setZoom()`
   API, (b) a number of seconds fit to the available width, or (c) the entire
   audio duration fit to the available width (@chrisn)

## 0.17.0 (2020/01/16)

 * (#302) Fixed segment handle dragging so that dragging the start marker does
   not change the segment end time, and vice versa (@chrisn)

 * Added `view.enableMarkerEditing()` method (@chrisn)

 * Updated Typescript definitions (@is343, @chrisn)

## 0.16.0 (2019/12/16)

   `overviewHighlightRectangleColor` option to `overviewHighlightColor`
   (@jodonnell)

## 0.14.2 (2019/11/05)

 * (#285) The axis labels are now correctly rendered on top of the waveform

## 0.14.0 (2019/10/23)

   The `segment.dragged` event now receives a boolean parameter that indicates
   whether the start or end marker is being dragged (@Spidy88)

## 0.13.1 (2019/10/22)

 * (#281) Fixed TypeScript definitions (@tscz)

 * Updated demo pages to use updated `Peaks.init()` API options (@chrisn)

## 0.13.0 (2019/09/11)

 * (#228, #240) Added ability to intialise a Peaks instance given an
   AudioBuffer

 * The API for creating waveforms using the Web Audio API has changed.
   Instead of passing an `audioContext` option to `Peaks.init()` or
   `peaksInstance.setSource()`, you shoud now pass a `webAudio` object,
   for example:

    ```javascript
    const options = {
      // ... etc
      webAudio: {
        audioContext: new AudioContext(),
        multiChannel: true
      }
    }

    Peaks.init(options, function(err, peaksInstance) { ... });
    ```

 * The (undocumented) `waveformBuilderOptions` option has also been removed.
   If you were using `amplitude_scale`, please use `view.setAmplitudeScale()`
   instead. The `scale` option is now determined by the lowest `zoomLevels`
   setting

 * Added `view.enableAutoScroll()` method

## 0.12.0 (2019/08/24)

 * (#194) Added multi-channel waveform support (@chrisn)

   `points.enter`, `segments.enter`, and `segments.exit` events during playback
   or on seeking (@gmarinov, @chrisn)

 * (#92) Added `setSource()` method to change the media element's source URL
   and update the waveform (@chrisn)

## 0.10.0 (2019/06/22)

 * (#247) Added `update()` methods to allow changes to segment and point
   properties (@zachsa)

 * (#250) Added `segments.mouseenter`, `segments.mouseleave`, and
   `segments.click` events (@zachsa)

   and non-zoomable ('overview') waveform views. Added example pages,
   in the 'demo' folder (@chrisn)

 * Updated to Konva 3.3.3 (@chrisn)

## 0.9.14 (2019/03/05)

 * (#249, #251, #252) Enabled touch events for waveform container
   and point and segment markers (@rfrei)

## 0.9.9 (2018/05/21)

 * Allow Peaks objects to be created using the new operator (@chrisn)

 * The `points.add()` and `segments.add()` methods now operate atomically. This
   change ensures that the input point/segment objects are validated before
   storing, so that if an exception is thrown, we leave the state of the
   points/segments array as it was before the function was called (@chrisn)

 * Added `points.mouseenter` and `points.mouseleave` events. Also added
   `points.dblclick`, which replaces the (previously undocumented)
`   pointDblClickHandler` config option (@markjongkind, @chrisn)

 * Added `points.dragstart` and `points.dragend` events, and renamed
   `points.dragged` to `points.dragmove`. The (also undocumented)
   `pointDragEndHandler` config option is deprecated (@chrisn)

   (@chrisn)

## 0.9.7 (2018/01/25)

 * (#104) Prevent "zoom level too low" exception when using the Web Audio API
   to compute the waveform data (@chrisn)

   when requesting waveform data files using XHR (@bennypowers)

 * (#212) Fixed `points.removeAll()` and `segments.removeAll()` (@chrisn)

 * Fixed a bug where the time axis would show the wrong times next to the
   axis markers (@chrisn)

 * Peaks.js is now available via cdnjs. Added a link to the ReadMe
   (@extend1994)

## 0.9.6 (2018/01/13)

 * (#112) Fixed a race condition where an audio element that contains
   one or more source elements is added to a page, and `Peaks.init()`
   is called before the audio element has selected which source
   to use. Also improved error reporting, to avoid a misleading "Unable to
   determine a compatible dataUri format for this browser" error (@chrisn)

## 0.9.5 (2017/12/11)

 * (#207) Prevent jump in playhead motion after starting playback
   (@chrisn, @jdelStrother)

   position next to the playhead marker (@chrisn)

   view after calling `player.seek()` (@chrisn)

   (@chrisn)

   `createPointMarker` functions (@chrisn)

 * Refactored `PointsLayer` and `SegmentsLayer` `_removeInvisiblePoints` methods
   (@chrisn)

## 0.9.1 (2017/08/29)

 * Fixed bug in IE11 which caused adding segment objects to fail (@chrisn)

## 0.9.0 (2017/08/16)

 * (#184, #116) Fixed waveform zoom and scrolling behaviour. Note that the
   animated zoom feature no longer works, and so static zoom is now always used,
   regardless of the `zoomAdapter` option (@chrisn)

 * Refactored `WaveformSegments` and `WaveformPoints` to separate the UI code
   into new `SegmentsLayer` and `PointsLayer` classes (@chrisn)

 * Points and segments are now represented by `Point` and `Segment` objects,
   rather than plain JavaScript objects (@chrisn)

 * Added `ZoomController` and `TimeController` classes to simplify main.js (@chrisn)

 * Added `PlayheadLayer` class and refactored `WaveformOverview` and

   (@chrisn)

 * Added `peaks.points.getPoint()` method (@chrisn)

 * Changed the keyboard interface so that the left/right arrow keys scroll the
   waveform by 1 second, and shift+left/right by one screen width (@chrisn)

 * Improved error messages (@chrisn)

 * Removed Node.js v4 and added v8 in Travis CI builds. Please use v6.0 or later
   to build Peaks.js (@chrisn)

 * Many other refactorings and code improvements (@chrisn)
